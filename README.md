## Description
This application will provide the weather on a 5-day forecast for cities inputted by the user. Functionalities include, but not limited to:

* Current and future weather conditions provided by OpenWeather API
* Organized layout to display city and weather related information
* Persisting information in Local Storage


## Project Status

My goal with this project is to try and resemble the blueprint given so I can focus on functionality and communication between the program and API.
