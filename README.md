## Description
This application will provide the weather on a 5-day forecast for cities inputted by the user. Functionalities include, but not limited to:

* Current and future weather conditions provided by OpenWeather API
* Organized layout to display city and weather related information
* Persisting information in Local Storage


## Project Status

My goal with this project is to try and resemble the blueprint given so I can focus on functionality and communication between the program and API. 

I've got the program communicating with the API to bring over the current day's weather and have it displayed alongside the 5 day forecast. Layout could still use some work. Setting and retrieving from Local Storage will need to be implemented as well as incorporating a history list where data persists. UV index needs to be incorporated as well.
